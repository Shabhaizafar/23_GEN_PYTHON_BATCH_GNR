Volume of Sphere in Python
Problem Description:

You are given a positive integer r denoting the radius of a sphere as a parameter. Write a program to calculate the volume of the sphere. The volume of a sphere having radius R is given by (4 * π * R3) / 3.

NOTE: Return the volume of the sphere up to two decimal places. You can use round().

NOTE2: Use pi as 22/7 (not math.pi).

Input Format:

The first line indicates the number of the test cases. For each testcase there will be one line of input:
The one line contains r in integer format.
Output Format:

The volume of the sphere in float format is printed for each testcase in a new line.
Sample Input:

1
8
Sample Output:

2145.52

String Concatenation I
Problem Description

You have 2 strings (A and B).

You have to concatenate two strings and return the concatenated string.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A.size() <= 1000

1 <= B.size() <= 1000



Input Format
First argument containing a lowercase string A.

Second argument containing a lowercase string B.



Output Format
You have to return concatenated string.



Example Input
Input 1:

A = "interview", B = "bit"


Example Output
Output 1:

interviewbit


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

Clearly, interview bit = interviewbit.

Print Substring!
Problem Description

Given a string A and two integer B and C.

Find and return the substring of A starting from index B and ending with index C.

NOTE:

Consider 0 based indexing.
Try to use direct library function to solve this.


Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 100

0 <= B, C < |A|



Input Format
First argument is an string A.

Second argument is an integer B.

Third argument is an integer C.



Output Format
Return the substring of A starting from index B and ending with index C.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = "rishabh"
 B = 1
 C = 2
Input 2:

 A = "ojas"
 B = 0
 C = 0


Example Output
Output 1:

 "is"
Output 2:

 "o"


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Substring from index 1 to index 2 in "rishabh" is "is".

FizzBuzz
Problem Description

Given a positive integer A, return an array of strings with all the integers from 1 to N. But for multiples of 3 the array should have “Fizz” instead of the number. For the multiples of 5, the array should have “Buzz” instead of the number. For numbers which are multiple of 3 and 5 both, the array should have "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

Look at the example for more details.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 500000



Input Format
The first argument has the integer A.



Output Format
Return an array of string.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = 5


Example Output
Output 1:

 [1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz]


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 3 is divisible by 3 so it is replaced by "Fizz".
 Similarly, 5 is divisible by 5 so it is replaced by "Buzz".

Leap year? - III
Problem Description

Given an integer A representing a year, Return 1 if it is a leap year else, return 0.

A year is a leap year if the following conditions are satisfied:

The year is multiple of 400.
or the year is multiple of 4 and not multiple of 100.

Problem Constraints

1 <= A <= 109



Input Format

First and only argument is an integer A



Output Format

Return 1 if it is a leap year else return 0



Example Input

Input 1

 A = 2020
Input 2:

 A = 1999


Example Output

Output 1

 1
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation

Explanation 1

 2020 is a leap year. 
 2020 is not a multiple of 400 but it is divisible by 4 and also at the same time not divisible by 100.
Explanation 2:

 1999 is not a leap year.
 199 is not a multiple of 400. It is not divisible by 4 and also at the same time not divisible by 100.
 All the conditions fail.
